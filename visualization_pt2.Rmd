load in a dataset
```{r}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(  # download the dataset 
    c("USW00094728", "USC00519397", "USS0023B17S"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), # pick three variabels that you care about
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%  # from 20170101 to 20171231
  mutate(
    name = recode(  # create a new name variable that recode the weather station
      id, 
      USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY", 
      USC00519397 = "Waikiki_HA",
      USS0023B17S = "Waterhole_WA"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
```{r}
weather_df
```

Start making some plots
# Scatterplot
tmax vs. tmin in a scatterplot
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature at Three station",
    x = "Minimum daily temp (C)",
    y = "Maximum daily temp (C)",
    caption = "Data from moaa package with three stations"
  )
```
## Scales

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature at Three station",
    x = "Minimum daily temp (C)",
    y = "Maximum daily temp (C)",
    caption = "Data from moaa package with three stations"
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(  # continuous variable on the x axis
    breaks = c(-15, 0, 15),
    labels = c("-15 C", "0", "15")
  ) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "sqrt",  # sqrt transformation
    position = "right"
  )
```
Color scales
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature at Three station",
    x = "Minimum daily temp (C)",
    y = "Maximum daily temp (C)",
    caption = "Data from moaa package with three stations"
  ) + 
  #scale_color_hue(h = c(100, 300))
  scale_color_viridis_d()  # d for discrete variable 
```
## Themes
aren't scale/ mapping related, but just to make plots look nicer
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature at Three station",
    x = "Minimum daily temp (C)",
    y = "Maximum daily temp (C)",
    caption = "Data from moaa package with three stations"
  ) + 
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() + # change background theme to bw/ classic/ minimal
  #ggthemes::theme_excel() + # graphs look like coming right from excel
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
